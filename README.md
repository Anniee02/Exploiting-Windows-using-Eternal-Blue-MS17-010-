# Exploiting-Windows-using-Eternal-Blue-MS17-010-
INTRODUCTION
Since the onset of the pandemic, everything has been shifted to online mode. The need for
cyber security is at its peak at the moment.
Recently, many IT infrastructures are facing challenges such as ransomware. These
ransomwares are spread through the Windows operating system.
In windows, there is a service called Server Message Block (SMB). This is a service used to
share files, ports and printers between networks. Vulnerability present in this service can
be transported across the network and hence, attacking the entire system.
This vulnerability is due to an error in handling maliciously crafted compressed data
packets within version 3.1. 1 of Server Message Blocks.
● EternalBlue:
EternalBlue is both the given name to a series of Microsoft software vulnerabilities and the
exploit created by the NSA as a cyberattack tool. Although the EternalBlue exploit — officially
named MS17-010 by Microsoft — affects only Windows operating systems, anything that uses
the SMBv1 (Server Message Block version 1) file-sharing protocol is technically at risk of being
targeted for ransomware and other cyberattacks.
● Working of EternalBlue:
The EternalBlue exploit works by taking advantage of SMBv1 vulnerabilities present in older
versions of Microsoft operating systems. SMBv1 was first developed in early 1983 as a network
communication protocol to enable shared access to files, printers, and ports. It was essentially a
way for Windows machines to talk to one another and other devices for remote services. The
exploit makes use of the way Microsoft Windows handles, or rather mishandles, specially crafted
packets from malicious attackers. All the attacker needs to do is send a maliciously-crafted packet
to the target server, and the malware propagates and a cyberattack ensues.
